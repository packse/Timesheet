Things that might need to be completed that could be useful

# Everything #
- Consider what actually needs to be referred to as a class variable and not make everything self.

# TimeslotTab #
- Will need to use stretch or margins or size policy to make the text look correct
- Use an alternating colour scheme (White/Grey) to make it easier to see the different timeslots separately

# AttendingPg #
- Remove scrolling for most of the fields so that a user doesn't accidentally scroll and mess up their selection
