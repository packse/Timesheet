Things that might need to be completed that could be useful

# Everything #
- Consider what actually needs to be referred to as a class variable and not make everything self.

# TimeslotTab #
- Will need to use stretch or margins or size policy to make the text look correct
- Use an alternating colour scheme (White/Grey) to make it easier to see the different timeslots separately

# AttendingPg #
- NEED TO STOP IT FROM BEING A PLACEHOLDER DATE FOR PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
- Will need the start and end Timeedits to increase by 15 minutes. Ideally this would be the only way it can increase.
This will prevent decimal points from showing up when entering a time such as 12:31
- Remove scrolling for most of the fields so that a user doesn't accidentally scroll and mess up their selection
