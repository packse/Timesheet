### Elements related to the pay period and entering times on the time sheet that will be the primary location users will
frequent most often ###

- Dates will be automatically entered based on pay period to reduce the requirement for users to enter it


## Different sections ##
- Depending on what type of work was performed and at what time there is a requirement that sections are created to
separate them. These include:
    - The usual Mon-Fri/Weekend jobs
    - Public holiday hours
    - Sick leave hours + Certificate's
    - Annual leave + Leave without pay
    - Training hrs


#  Mon-Fri/Weekend Jobs #
- This refers to jobs that are completed within normal times without additional modifiers such as public holidays and
training hrs
- For these jobs the start, finish time and breaks is all that needs to be entered and it will automatically calculate
if it is a weekend, and how much time elapsed from start to finish - breaks.
- E.g If it started from 7 to 3 then 7 hours have elapsed. Minus a break of 30 mins the total would be calculated as
7.5 hours


# Public Holidays #
- Public holidays are calculated by determining which day was the public holiday and transferring the hrs from that day
 to public holiday hours.
        - E.g. If the public holiday was during Mon-Fri hours at 7 hrs total we would simply make Mon-Fri hrs 0 and
        transfer that amount to public holiday hours.
- The reason this is complex is because public holiday hours may start on the Friday but end on the Saturday if done
during night shift which needs to be accounted for in calculations.


# Sick Leave + Certificate handling #
- On days where the user doesn't enter for work the hours of sick leave need to be entered. If a certificate is attained
this also needs to be confirmed as a yes/no query
- In regards to sick leave hours it can be expected that the user is not available for the entire day and so will not
be considered for annual leave or leave without pay
- Additionally the start/finish time is not entered. Instead just the hours that would have been spent at work normally
is written in (usually 8 hours)


# Annual Leave hrs/Leave without pay hrs #
- This includes time spent away from work but making use of annual leave.
- Similar to sick leave only the hours that would normally be spent at work needs to be entered (usually 8 hours)
- While annual leave and leave without pay are technically separate the user would only need to enter within annual
leave and the company would determine if they still have hours left that they could be compensated for.
    - As a result only a single field for annual leave hours is required as leave without pay column is rarely used


# Training Hours #
- Training hours are added on top of the normal hours, separate from the calculation performed using start/finish time
and so only need an additional field and no interaction with other fields
- They are however only occur monday to friday
