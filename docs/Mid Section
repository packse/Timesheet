# Elements related to the pay period and entering times on the time sheet that will be the primary location users will
frequent most often #

- Dates will be automatically entered based on pay period to reduce the requirement for users to enter it
- On public holiday's a check box would be simplest to denote it being the case. This could similarly be the case for
sick leave hrs/annual leave hrs/leave without pay hrs
- Training hours are added on top of the normal hours so they would have their own separate field
    - Possible that the field would be hidden unless the user selects it
