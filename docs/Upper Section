# This includes all of the data that will mostly remain constant for each employee. For example the employee name and
classification as it won't need to change often if at all #

- Employee name will be a text field entered and after saving will be stored to increase speed of entering data
- Classification will work identical to employee name

- Both will be placed at the top underneath the the heading elements and will be separate from the elements below it
such as time related elements like pay period and time sheet entering.
